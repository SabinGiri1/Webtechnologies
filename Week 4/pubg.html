        PUBG: Battlegrounds (formerly known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is a battle royale game developed by PUBG Studios and published by Krafton. Inspired by the Japanese film Battle Royale (2000), the game builds on previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, and was expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. It is the first game in the PUBG Universe series. The game is played from a third-person or first-person perspective. In the game, up to a hundred players parachute onto an island where they scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill other players while avoiding getting killed. The available safe area of ​​the game map decreases over time, driving surviving players into an increasingly cramped space to force encounters. The last player (or team) left wins the round. It was first released for Windows via Steam's early access beta program in March 2017, with a full release in December 2017. The game was also released the same month by Microsoft Studios for Xbox One via the Xbox Game program Preview and officially released in September 2018. PUBG Mobile, a free-to-play mobile game version for Android and iOS, was released in 2018 alongside a port for PlayStation 4. A version for the Stadia streaming platform was released in April 2020, with the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions released in November 2020. The game has been free for all platforms since January 12, 2022.
